Can the Fourier Neural Operator Achieve Super Resolution for the Prediction of  Stress and Damage Fields in Composites? 

A novel deep learning technique is applied to create a surrogate model for the full-field predictions of stress and damage in composite materials. The model is developed using the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and outputs elastic stress fields and local damage maps. The model makes these predictions with high resolution Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) as inputs. These RVEs are randomly generated to produce diverse training and testing data containing geometric variabilities such as fibre volume fraction and porosity. The development and testing of the surrogate models demonstrate the power of the FNO compared to traditional physics-based systems of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), and classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The FNO models are evaluated using unseen data to prevent biased results from the training data. After training, the FNO produces accurate full-field predictions up to 1.5Ã—10^4 times faster than the physics-based model while also demonstrating resolution invariance. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the FNO highlights it as a powerful method for multiscale simulation and microstructure optimisation.
